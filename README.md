# New-Password-Validator
The Password Validator is a JS code written to check whether a password fits the variables of length, capitalizaiton and if it includes special characters and more.
There is also a link to my Codecademy account where the code is demonstrated.
# HOW TO USE
Once the code is activated it ueses a function to check if the parameters return a value of true or false.
To enter your password you must go to the bottom of the code where the function isPasswordValid is called and within the brackets, input your desired password.
The console should then output that your password either meets the desired parameters or if there is something wrong it will display an error message telling you what is wrong.
